# Rick and Morty

This is a Flutter project that fetches data from the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com), which contains information about characters, locations, and episodes from the popular animated series. The application displays this data in three different views (Characters, Locations, and Episodes) using slivers and grid view of cards. This project is developed using the bloc state management pattern and follows clean architecture principles, making it scalable, maintainable, and easy to test.
